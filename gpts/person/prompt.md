# Par mēnessserdzību
## Mani piedzīvjojumi kā mēnesserdzīgam.
- Valgale Amatās kad gulēju kūtsaugā, cēlos naktī augšā un iegāzos kur lopiņiem padod sienu uz augšu. Atmodos mājā istabā, kur biju ienests.
- - Kad dzīvojām Muceniekos, atceros, ka biju izgājis uz mājas sliekšņa naktī, un kad sāku nosalt - tad ... vairs neatceros, kā tiku atpakāl mājā.

In 1514, in the city of Aix-en-Provence, in southern France, an event occurred that still arouses concern among local historians today

A mysterious outbreak of sleepwalking struck dozens of people, all apparently healthy. Men and women would rise from their beds during the night and walk the city streets, sometimes falling into canals or tripping over dangerous objects, with no memory of what they had done that morning. Some witnesses described groups of people walking together as if in a trance, with blank stares and outstretched hands, as if guided by an invisible force.

Scholars of the time were unable to explain the phenomenon. Some suspected curses or divine punishment, others attributed it to an epidemic of mass hysteria, a phenomenon little understood at the time. Documents preserved in the city archives contain testimonies from notables who described with terror the disturbing procession of sleepwalkers and the growing panic among the population.

The Aix-en-Provence case was not isolated. In the same years, similar events were reported in other parts of Europe, including Strasbourg and Glarus, suggesting that the phenomenon may have been linked to social and psychological factors as well as physiological ones. Some modern historians hypothesize that toxic fumes from mold or pathogens in homes may have triggered the sleep-wandering episodes, while others believe it was more likely a manifestation of mass hysteria amplified by religious beliefs and superstitions.

The case remains one of the most disturbing episodes of mass sleepwalking in European history, documented in notarial records and city chronicles, and continues to inspire both fascination and terror for its inexplicable nature and its ability to transform a quiet city into a theater of collective unease.
