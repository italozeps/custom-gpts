The content of the book:
Exterior Algebra: Introduction to dual bases, wedge products, inner derivatives, and their properties in the context of forms and vector spaces.
Differential Forms on Open Subsets of ℝⁿ: Tangent vectors, frames, pullbacks, and integration of forms, concluding with Stokes' theorem.
