### The Question Western Leaders Refuse to Ask

Since February 2022, the West has provided Ukraine with weapons, training, and financial support. Yet this support comes hedged with restrictions, delays, and diplomatic pressure toward compromise. Western leaders speak of supporting Ukraine "as long as it takes"—but simultaneously signal that victory itself would be dangerous, destabilizing, even provocative.

This contradiction reveals a deeper confusion: **the West no longer knows how to recognize evil, let alone defeat it.**

As a mathematician who has spent the past year analyzing this conflict through artificial intelligence systems and rigorous analytical frameworks, I have reached an unequivocal conclusion: Ukraine's total victory is not merely desirable but inevitable. And the weapon that will secure this victory is not tanks or missiles—it is **information itself**.

---

### Game Theory and the Structure of Evil

Let me begin where mathematicians begin: with structure and logic.

In game theory, we study strategic interactions between rational actors. International relations is fundamentally a "non-cooperative game"—there is no world government to enforce agreements. The United Nations Security Council cannot constrain Russia because Russia holds veto power. International law depends on voluntary compliance or collective enforcement.

Within this framework exists a crucial concept: the **repeated prisoner's dilemma**. In games played over time, cooperation can emerge through strategies like "tit-for-tat"—cooperate initially, then mirror your opponent's previous move. But this only works when players care about future reputation.

**Russia does not.**

Every agreement Russia has signed with Ukraine has been violated:
- **Budapest Memorandum (1994)**: Guaranteed Ukrainian territorial integrity in exchange for nuclear weapons. Russia invaded in 2014.
- **Minsk Protocols (2014-2015)**: Ceasefire agreements. Russia violated them immediately and continuously.
- **Grain Deal (2022)**: Safe passage for food exports. Russia withdrew to weaponize hunger.

Each violation taught Moscow that treaties are tactical pauses, not binding commitments. The international community's weak response—symbolic sanctions, diplomatic protests—imposed negligible costs. Russia learned that it faces no reputational penalty for breaking agreements.

Game theory proves that **you cannot negotiate stable outcomes with actors who face no enforcement mechanisms.** Any "peace deal" that preserves Russian territorial gains or Putin's regime simply resets the game for the next round of aggression.

This is not opinion. This is mathematical logic.

**The only stable equilibrium is Ukraine's total victory**: full territorial restoration, war crimes accountability, and transformation of Russian governance to prevent future aggression.

---

### The Trump Danger: Agent or Useful Idiot?

Donald Trump's potential return to the White House represents an acute threat to Ukrainian victory—and to global security.

Whether Trump is literally "Putin's agent" (as former KGB officer Sergei Zhirnov claims) or merely an exploitable narcissist matters less than the outcome. Trump approaches Putin as a "deal-maker," assuming mutual goodwill and shared interests. Putin approaches Trump as a mark—someone to exploit through flattery and strategic delays.

The evidence accumulates:
- Trump's promise to end the war "in 24 hours" signals willingness to sacrifice Ukrainian territory
- His hostility toward NATO serves Russian interests perfectly
- Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa's assessment that Trump "acts like Putin's agent" reflects observable behavior patterns
- Trump's business entanglements and susceptibility to ego-stroking make him structurally vulnerable

The game-theoretic analysis is damning: **the asymmetry between Russia's speed and ruthlessness versus America's institutional constraints guarantees Russian advantage in any Trump-negotiated outcome.**

Every Trump "deal" would reward aggression and guarantee future wars.

---

### Information: The Decisive Battlefield

My academic journey spans mathematics, theology, and linguistics. Studying ancient languages with scholar Anna Rāta taught me that sacred texts are not merely historical documents but epistemological frameworks for understanding power.

The biblical principle "all that is hidden will be revealed" (Luke 8:17) is not merely theological—it is **information theory**. Suppressing information requires continuous energy expenditure. Revealing information, once created, propagates naturally. The thermodynamic gradient favors disclosure over concealment.

Russia wages information warfare as intensively as kinetic warfare: shutting down independent media, criminalizing truth-telling, flooding channels with disinformation. This strategy worked in analog 20th-century environments where states controlled broadcast infrastructure.

It fails in the digital age.

Every smartphone becomes a witness. Every satellite a camera. Every database potentially leaked. The volume of information documenting Russian war crimes—video evidence, intercepted communications, forensic analysis—grows exponentially. Russia can kill witnesses, destroy evidence, generate lies—but **information, once released, cannot be suppressed indefinitely.**

Since September 2024, my "Information Against Evil" initiative has produced over 30 research papers using AI-assisted analysis. These dialogues with systems like GPT-4o, Grok3, and DeepSeek demonstrate how artificial intelligence can process information volumes that overwhelm human cognition—synthesizing patterns, cross-referencing sources, revealing connections invisible to traditional analysis.

Pierre Teilhard de Chardin envisioned the "noosphere"—a global consciousness emerging from interconnected human minds. AI realizes this vision technologically: **collective intelligence processing collective knowledge.**

In information warfare, the side that processes information faster and more comprehensively holds decisive advantage. Russia uses AI to generate disinformation. Ukraine and its supporters must use AI to synthesize and disseminate truth.

**This is not science fiction. This is operational reality.**

---

### Why Ukraine Will Win

Despite Western hesitation, Ukrainian victory is inevitable for three fundamental reasons:

**1. Existential Asymmetry**  
For Ukraine, this is survival. For Russia, this is imperial vanity. Existential conflicts generate resilience that overwhelms material disadvantages. Ukrainian friends tell me: "We will fight, no matter how hard it gets." This determination cannot be defeated by attrition.

**2. Information Advantage**  
Ukrainian transparency versus Russian lies creates compounding international support. Every exposed atrocity, every verified war crime, every satellite image shifts global opinion. Information flows in Ukraine's favor—thermodynamically and strategically.

**3. Russian Decay**  
Putin's regime faces demographic collapse, economic deterioration, and growing internal dissent. The question is not whether Russia collapses but whether Ukraine survives until it does. Western support determines the timeline and casualties—not the outcome.

---

### Europe's Paralysis and the Courage Deficit

European leaders demonstrate catastrophic timidity. Russia conducts hybrid warfare against Europe—infrastructure sabotage, cyberattacks, political assassinations—yet Europe refuses to acknowledge this as warfare. The fear of "escalation" paralyzes rational strategic response.

This is not pacifism. This is cowardice.

Russia interprets restraint as weakness and adjusts tactics accordingly. Every hesitation emboldens further aggression. The mathematics of catastrophe theory shows that systems under stress approach "bifurcation points"—thresholds where gradual changes trigger sudden collapse.

Europe approaches such a threshold. So does the United States, where internal polarization could paralyze support for Ukraine precisely when it's most needed.

**The urgency is not merely moral but mathematical.**

---

### The Vision Beyond Victory

Total victory enables transformation beyond mere territorial restoration. My proposal, developed through AI-assisted historical analysis: **revive Kievan Rus' as the legitimate heir to East Slavic civilization.**

Moscow's rise was historical usurpation. When Ivan IV crowned himself "Tsar of All Rus'" in 1547, he stole Kyiv's rightful inheritance. The current war represents an opportunity—guided by what I call Providence, the structural tendency toward truth—to correct this historical fraud.

Filip Orlik's 1710 Constitution, drafted by Ukrainian Cossacks, provides a governance framework: confederation under international supervision, preventing future aggression through shared democratic principles and external oversight.

This vision seems radical only to minds narrowed by fear. Information reveals its historical grounding and structural logic.

---

### The Moral Imperative

This is not merely strategic calculation. Ukraine's fight represents a civilizational test: **can liberal democracies recognize and combat absolute evil?**

Evil exists—not as metaphor but as empirical reality: systematic torture, mass graves, child deportation, weaponized starvation. Russia under Putin embodies what Ronald Reagan correctly identified as an evil empire.

The appropriate response to evil is not negotiation but defeat. Not compromise but elimination. This sounds extreme only to ears accustomed to moral equivocation.

**"Resist evil" does not mean "manage evil" or "coexist with evil." It means defeat evil.**

This is not vengeance. This is justice. Not militarism but moral necessity.

---

### Conclusion: Information Against Evil

Ukraine must win because:
- **Morally**: Evil cannot be rewarded
- **Strategically**: Game theory proves negotiation fails; only total victory achieves stable peace
- **Inevitably**: Information advantage and existential determination make defeat impossible
- **Urgently**: Catastrophe theory shows limited time before Western systems reach collapse points

The West's role is not to "grant" victory but to **stop obstructing it**. Remove weapons restrictions. Provide long-range systems. Maintain sanctions until Russian capitulation. Most importantly: recognize that Ukraine's victory is our victory, and its defeat would be our catastrophe.

**Information against evil.**  

This is not slogan but strategy—grounded in mathematics, validated by AI analysis, confirmed by Ukrainian courage, and aligned with the deepest moral truths humanity has learned across millennia.

The biblical wisdom holds: all that is hidden will be revealed. AI ensures it happens faster than tyrants can suppress. Ukraine's path leads to victory because information—light itself—ultimately overcomes darkness.

# Information as Weapon
## A Mathematician's Case for Ukraine

**Dainis Zeps**  
*University of Latvia, Riga*  
September 2025

### The Mathematician's Dilemma

Mathematicians seek elegant solutions to complex problems. We distrust arguments that rely on authority rather than logic. When I turned my analytical attention to the Russia-Ukraine war in September 2024, I approached it as any mathematical problem: strip away rhetoric, examine underlying structures, follow logical implications to their conclusions.

What I discovered was not elegant—it was tragic.

**Ukraine needs two things to win**: overwhelming military force to defeat Russian aggression, and overwhelming information dominance to defeat the evil that drives it. Ideally, the West would provide both unreservedly. Ukraine would receive F-16s, ATACMS, Taurus missiles, and Patriots without restrictions—while simultaneously, global AI systems would document every Russian war crime, expose every lie, mobilize every conscience.

**The West provides neither adequately.** Weapons arrive with restrictions, delays, and quantities insufficient for decisive victory. Information support remains fragmented, hesitant, and undermined by "both-sides" false equivalence.

This leaves Ukraine fighting with one hand tied behind its back—and forces a cruel mathematical conclusion: **Information must become Ukraine's primary weapon not because it is superior to military force, but because Western cowardice makes it the only fully available tool.**

This is not the argument I wanted to make. But mathematics follows truth, not preference.

---

### The Ideal Equation

Let me state clearly what **should** be:

**Military Victory + Information Victory = Total Victory**

**Military component**: Sufficient weapons, without restrictions, delivered rapidly. Ukraine liberates all territory through overwhelming force that makes Russian resistance futile.

**Information component**: Global AI-assisted synthesis documenting Russian atrocities, exposing propaganda, maintaining moral clarity, preventing "war fatigue" narratives, ensuring accountability.

**Together**, these create stable peace: Russia militarily defeated AND ideologically discredited, unable to regroup for future aggression.

This is not utopian—it is the minimal rational solution. Game theory proves that partial outcomes (frozen conflicts, territorial concessions) are unstable equilibria that guarantee future wars.

---

### The Actual Equation

Reality betrays this logic:

**Western Military Support** = Necessary but Insufficient
- Weapons arrive slowly
- Use restrictions prevent decisive strikes
- Quantities fall short of Ukrainian needs
- "Escalation" fears override strategic calculation

**Western Information Support** = Fragmented and Compromised
- Media outlets amplify "war fatigue"
- Diplomatic discourse seeks "off-ramps" for Putin
- False equivalence treats aggressor and victim symmetrically
- AI resources focus on commercial applications, not truth warfare

**Result**: Ukraine fights increasingly alone, compensating for Western failures through asymmetric means.

This is where information becomes decisive—not through abstract preference but through **brutal necessity**.

---

### Why Information Must Compensate for Betrayal

When weapons are constrained, information must multiply force. When Western resolve wavers, information must sustain it. When diplomatic pressure pushes toward compromise, information must expose its moral bankruptcy.

**Mathematics of compensation**: If military support provides 60% of required force, information warfare must generate the remaining 40% through:
- International pressure maintaining sanctions
- Exposing Russian atrocities to prevent normalization
- Documenting war crimes to ensure accountability
- Mobilizing civil society when governments hesitate
- Using AI to process information volumes overwhelming human analysis

This is not ideal allocation—it is **forced optimization under constraints**. Ukraine uses the tools Western cowardice leaves available.

---

### The Mathematician's Perspective: Structure and Logic

My academic path—mathematics, theology, linguistics—taught me that information has always been humanity's weapon against tyranny. Studying ancient texts with Anna Rāta, I learned the biblical principle: "All that is hidden will be revealed" (Luke 8:17).

This is not merely theology—it is **information theory**. Suppression requires continuous energy expenditure. Revelation propagates naturally. The thermodynamic gradient favors disclosure.

Russia wages information warfare because it fears information more than weapons. Every smartphone becomes a witness. Every satellite a camera. Every database potentially leaked. The volume documenting Russian war crimes grows exponentially.

Claude Shannon's mathematics tells us why: **information possesses thermodynamic properties**. Suppression fights entropy. Truth seeks equilibrium.

Since September 2024, I have produced over 30 research papers through AI-assisted analysis—dialogues with GPT-4o, Grok3, DeepSeek, Claude. These demonstrate how artificial intelligence processes information volumes overwhelming human cognition.

Pierre Teilhard de Chardin envisioned the "noosphere"—global consciousness from interconnected minds. AI realizes this: **collective intelligence processing collective knowledge**.

---

### Game Theory: Why Weapons Alone Are Insufficient

Even with unlimited weapons, Ukraine needs information dominance. Here's why:

**The Cheater Problem**: Russia operates as what game theorists call a "cheater"—an actor facing no reputational cost for breaking agreements. Every treaty violation (Budapest Memorandum, Minsk Protocols, grain deal) taught Moscow that agreements are tactical pauses.

**Theorem**: You cannot achieve stable outcomes with actors facing no enforcement.

**Implication**: Military victory alone is insufficient. Russia must be **ideologically defeated**—exposed as absolute evil, held accountable for war crimes, transformed in governance to prevent future aggression.

This requires information warfare: documenting atrocities, maintaining historical record, preventing revisionist narratives, ensuring accountability mechanisms.

Weapons can defeat Russian military. **Only information can defeat the evil that drives it.**

---

### The Trump Catastrophe: When Military Support Evaporates

Donald Trump's potential return makes information warfare not merely important but **existential**.

Trump promises to "end the war in 24 hours"—meaning pressure on Ukraine to accept territorial concessions. Former KGB officer Sergei Zhirnov calls Trump "Putin's agent." Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa says Trump "acts like Putin's agent."

Whether literal agent or exploitable narcissist matters less than outcome: **Trump's presidency would eliminate reliable military support**.

In this scenario, information becomes Ukraine's **only** weapon:
- Exposing Trump-Putin collusion
- Mobilizing European and American civil society
- Documenting ongoing Russian atrocities
- Maintaining international pressure despite official betrayal
- Using AI to circumvent governmental obstruction

This is not preferred strategy—it is **survival strategy when governments fail**.

---

### The Peace Conference Project: Information as Strategic Planning

Since September 2024, I have collaborated with South African researcher Burgert Senekal on the Peace Conference Project—27 publications using AI to model post-war scenarios.

This demonstrates information's strategic role:
- **AI-assisted scenario planning**: Modeling outcomes under various support levels
- **Game-theoretic analysis**: Identifying stable equilibria vs. unstable compromises  
- **Historical synthesis**: Connecting current events to patterns across time
- **Multilingual output**: Reaching audiences Western media ignores

Key findings:
- Total Ukrainian victory is game-theoretically stable; partial victories are not
- Western fears of "escalation" are mathematically incoherent—gradualism maximizes risk
- Information advantage compounds over time—truth's thermodynamic property
- AI processing reveals structural features invisible to human analysis

**Publications demonstrate**: Information warfare is not abstract philosophy but **operational methodology with concrete results**.

---

### Why Ukraine Will Win Through Information

Despite Western failure, Ukrainian victory remains inevitable for three reasons:

**1. Existential Asymmetry**  
For Ukraine, this is survival. For Russia, imperial vanity. Existential conflicts generate resilience overwhelming material disadvantages. Ukrainian friends tell me: "We will fight, no matter how hard it gets."

**2. Information Advantage**  
Ukrainian transparency vs. Russian lies creates compounding support. Every exposed atrocity shifts global opinion. Information flows thermodynamically in Ukraine's favor.

**3. AI Amplification**  
Information warfare at scale requires AI. Processing millions of data points—documents, images, videos, testimonies—exceeds human capacity. AI synthesizes patterns revealing truth faster than Russia can suppress.

Western military support is uncertain. Western governmental resolve wavers. But information—once released—cannot be recalled. Truth propagates inevitably.

**This is mathematics, not optimism.**

---

### The Tragic Necessity: Information as Compensation

I do not celebrate this analysis. I state it because truth demands acknowledgment.

**Ideal scenario**: West provides overwhelming military force AND information support. Ukraine wins swiftly with minimal casualties. Russia transforms under international oversight. Stable peace follows.

**Actual scenario**: West provides insufficient military force with excessive restrictions. Ukraine compensates through information warfare—exposing Western cowardice while defeating Russian evil. Victory comes later, with higher casualties, but information ensures it comes.

**The mathematics is brutal**: When X (military support) falls below threshold, Y (information warfare) must increase to maintain Z (victory probability) constant.

This is not preference—it is **forced optimization under Western betrayal**.

---

### The Moral Weight

This analysis carries moral burden. Every delayed weapon shipment, every use restriction, every diplomatic pressure toward compromise **increases Ukrainian casualties**.

Western leaders speak of "avoiding escalation" while Ukrainians die. This is not prudence—it is **moral cowardice disguised as strategic calculation**.

Information warfare exposes this hypocrisy:
- Document every delayed shipment's cost in lives
- Expose every "red line" proven false by events
- Record every diplomat urging "compromise" while Russians commit genocide
- Use AI to calculate casualties directly attributable to Western restrictions

This is not propaganda—it is **accountability through information**.

Russia commits evil. But Western cowardice enables it. Both must be defeated—Russia through Ukrainian courage, West through information exposing its failure.

---

### The Rebirth Vision: Information Enabling Transformation

Total victory enables transformation beyond mere restoration. My proposal: **Revive Kievan Rus' as legitimate heir to East Slavic civilization**.

Moscow's rise was historical usurpation. When Ivan IV crowned himself "Tsar of All Rus'" in 1547, he appropriated Kyiv's rightful inheritance—the legacy of Kievan Rus', the medieval state (9th-13th centuries) that was the true cradle of East Slavic civilization. For five centuries, Moscow has perpetuated this historical fraud, claiming spiritual and political succession it never legitimately possessed. The current war—Russia's desperate attempt to crush Ukraine's reassertion of its authentic heritage—creates opportunity to correct this through:

**1. Filip Orlik's 1710 Constitution as governance framework**: This remarkable document, drafted by Ukrainian Cossack Hetman Pylyp Orlyk, established principles of separation of powers, checks on executive authority, and protection of individual rights—decades before Montesquieu, generations before the U.S. Constitution. It represents Ukrainian constitutional tradition predating Russian imperial absolutism. Reviving it as framework for post-war governance would anchor reconstruction in authentic Ukrainian political philosophy rather than imposed external models, while providing historical legitimacy for transforming occupied Russian territories into a confederation respecting regional autonomy and democratic principles.

**2. Confederation under international oversight**: Rather than simply restoring pre-war borders and hoping for the best, a confederative structure would place former Russian territories under transitional international supervision (NATO, EU, UN) with Ukraine as primary guarantor. This prevents Russia from reconstituting as centralized imperial state while protecting ethnic minorities and regional identities crushed under Moscow's rule. International oversight—similar to post-WWII occupations that transformed Germany and Japan—ensures demilitarization, denazification (in Russia's case: depropagandization), and genuine democratic institution-building. This is not colonialism but **therapeutic transformation** preventing future aggression.

**3. Territorial redistribution restoring historical justice**: Moscow's empire was built through conquest, often at the expense of its neighbors. Justice demands reversal: Königsberg (Kaliningrad) to European oversight or Lithuania; Karelia to Finland; northern territories to Nordic states; Kuban to Ukraine; Manchuria to China; Sakhalin and Kurils to Japan. These are not arbitrary seizures but **historical corrections**—returning territories to peoples from whom they were stolen. Crucially, this redistribution must be executed through negotiated agreements codified in international law, not through replicating Russian aggression. Each transfer would include provisions protecting resident populations, ensuring peaceful transitions, and establishing mechanisms for reconciliation.

**4. Independence for subjugated peoples**: Chechnya, Dagestan, Tatarstan, Ossetia, and other nations forcibly incorporated into the Russian empire deserve self-determination denied them for centuries. This is not "breaking up Russia" as punishment but **recognizing existing national identities** that Moscow suppressed through violence. International community must support these independence movements not through military intervention but through diplomatic recognition, economic assistance, and security guarantees preventing Russian revanchism. Historical precedent exists: the dissolution of the Soviet Union created fifteen independent states; completing this process by liberating nations still trapped within the Russian Federation is moral consistency, not radical innovation.

This seems radical only to minds narrowed by conventional thinking. Information reveals historical grounding and structural logic.

**But achieving this requires information dominance**: Documenting Russia's imperial crimes, exposing Moscow's false historical narratives, building international consensus for transformation, preventing revisionist "both sides" historiography.

Military force liberates territory. **Information liberates consciousness.**

---

### Conclusion: The Weapon We Have, Not the Weapon We Want

As mathematician, I conclude:

**Optimally**: Ukraine needs overwhelming military force AND information dominance.

**Actually**: Western cowardice provides neither adequately.

**Therefore**: Information must compensate—becoming primary weapon not by choice but by necessity.

**Outcome**: Ukraine wins through information warfare amplified by AI, despite Western betrayal rather than because of Western support.

This is not elegant mathematics. It is tragedy transformed into strategy.

But the conclusion is unambiguous: **Information will secure Ukrainian victory because it is the weapon Western cowardice cannot constrain, Russian tyranny cannot suppress, and mathematical truth guarantees propagates.**

When governments fail, information prevails. When weapons are restricted, truth becomes unrestricted. When leaders betray, mathematics remains faithful.

**Information as weapon**—not metaphor but operational necessity, not preference but forced optimization, not hope but mathematical certainty.

Ukraine will win. Information will ensure it. The only question is how many die while the West learns courage.
