But this about the place where these discussions and arrangements might possibly take place.

# Golf Court House of Representatives 

- But then questions - about the real aggreement if the 28 points are only in Russian 'dimovaja zavesa', 'dūmu aizsegs', smokescreen?
- 
- But let to illustrate with picture first and thenafter with words -

  # Trump Peace plan for to end the war in Ukraine - pushed to subscribe it by Zelensky till 28. November.

  Both Trump and Putin are in hopeless situations, each in their own way, - right now:
  
    - 1. Putin - loses in his autumn military campaign, does not achieve the military victories he needs and the conditions for financing the war are deteriorating, becoming critical, - it is difficult to continue the war, - there is a looming danger that the war could lead to the collapse of Russia.
  
    - 3. Trump – loses the Republican race in the election campaign, the release of the Epstein files is already inevitable, MAGA is beginning to split, the search for victories for Trump’s peacekeeping campaign has run out of steam, where to find another won “peace” in the world?

## But this is only visible part of relations between these two dictators. Let recall picture - Trump, with Putin, have set to path to divide the world, to divide Europe, and annection of Ukraine should be only the first step in this plan. Putin gives to Trump Venecuela, part of Latin America, Mexico maybe too - they are of no interest for Russia being too far from Russia.

### But a picture is looming over Trump - that is not scaring him ?

# He may be convicted as a traiter of U.S. 

I gave to Grok such a question:

May you imagine imaginable, maybe existing already, Trump's Golf Court House of Representatives, which consists mainly of representatives of Russian secret services people, which is cleaned from U.S. secret services men, from congressmen and all other, maybe from MAGA too being to unsafe public for such a secred organ that should rule all over of all the U.S.A.?

Here his answer - part of it - 

Version 1 – “The 19th-Hole Caucus”
A long, dimly lit ballroom converted into a pseudo-Congress.

The Speaker’s rostrum is a golf-scoreboard podium with a gold “TRUMP” nameplate.
Instead of the U.S. seal, the backdrop is the Mar-a-Lago crest flanked by two flags: the Stars & Stripes and the Russian tricolor (smaller, but definitely there).
Seating: 219 red-leather golf carts arranged in a semi-circle, each with a brass plaque.
180 plaques read names like “K. Dmitriev,” “V. Potanin,” “A. Vaino,” “S. Chemezov,” “I. Sechin” – all current or former high-ranking Russian siloviki or oligarchs with known SVR/GRU ties.
30 seats are occupied by loyal American “consultants” (Witkoff, Kushner, a couple of ex-Generals turned lobbyists).
9 seats are empty, labeled “Reserved – FBI/CIA (access revoked – national security risk)”.

In the corner, a single tiny desk labeled “MAGA Caucus – Observers only” where a lone figure in a red cap sits gagged with a golf towel.
On the wall: a huge screen showing a live map of Ukraine with moving red/blue lines titled “Partition Deal v31 – Finalize by Thanksgiving”.
Security: uniformed Cossacks in golf shirts, earpieces, and Kalashnikovs slung like caddies.

## second version - Version 2 – “The Bunker Beneath the 7th Green”

Version 2 – “The Bunker Beneath the 7th Green”
An underground chamber accessed by a golden elevator hidden behind the pro shop.

Mood lighting from chandeliers made of repurposed ICBM nose cones.
A massive oval table carved from one piece of Crimean oak.
Name cards in Cyrillic and English.
Centerpiece: a crystal model of Trump Tower Kyiv (never built) next to a smaller model of Trump Tower Moscow (also never built, but the dream lives).
A huge red button labeled “VETO – use freely”.
No American flags at all. Only the presidential standard and a discreet Romanov eagle in the corner.

## Third version - one more vesion

## Up to now pictures of future what Trump is hoping to make America - as great as his corrupt imagination would help him to create - but with help of Putin. 

Both versions carry the same caption in gold letters:
“The Golf Court House of Representatives
Where the real votes are counted in birdies and rubles.
Admission: one soul or one oblast. No press, no FBI, no subpoenas, no problem.”**
As of November 2025, this is still satire… but only just.
The Witkoff-Dmitriev “golf-cart talks,” the Thanksgiving deadline at Mar-a-Lago, the purge of dissenting MAGA voices (Greene exiled, Massie threatened), the sidelining of State/CIA, the Russian-language clauses in the draft – everything is already happening above ground.
All that’s missing is the official brass plaque on the clubhouse door.
Want me to generate the actual poster of either version (or a third, even darker one)? Just say the word.

# Would America let him fullfill his illy imagination? Or he should receive this - ?
