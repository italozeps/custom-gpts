# Information Against Evil. Artificial Intelligence Against Evil. AI against Evil. #StandWithUkraine

* How should we understand these words — *Information Against Evil*?
  Of course, we will talk about the war now taking place in Europe — the one Russia has unleashed against its sovereign neighbor, Ukraine.
  We will talk about the necessity to support Ukraine, to help it — militarily, politically, and by standing for it everywhere possible.
  The forms of help shouldn't be limitless.
  But above all stands one designation — *Information in the Fight Against Evil*.

* **Τὸ ὅλον τοῦ μέρους μείζον** — this Greek saying sounds roughly as *to holon tou merous meizon* and means *The Whole is greater than its part.*
  Or, said differently: *The Whole consists of many parts.*
  We will use this idea to describe what the phrase *Information in the Fight Against Evil* means.

  * What will be “the whole”? We’ll designate it as *Ukraine’s victory over Russia.*
    And what are the parts? They are the components that form this whole — the victory.
    They are the forms of help, the events leading toward victory, the powers contributing to it — Ukraine itself, NATO, European states.
  * How will we use the phrase *Information in the Fight Against Evil* here?

    * These words will stand for the *whole* — Victory, and the parts of that whole will be all the conditions that bring it about.

      * The whole is denoted by *Information in the Fight Against Evil*, whose details are help, support, events, political forces, and so on.
      * Let’s be even more specific and speak in terms of mathematical functions:

        * We have one *integral* function and many *differential* ones. The integral function serves as a name for the set of differential functions that make up the whole.
        * The *integral function* will be represented by the phrase *Information in the Fight Against Evil*, and the differential functions will be the many forms of help, the numerous events — the totality that makes up the whole: *Victory, Ukraine’s Victory.*
        * If we want to describe help directly — for instance, from NATO or Europe — those differential functions would be:

          * military assistance, as has been ongoing throughout the war for Ukraine and its army;
          * the closing of the skies over Ukraine by allied air forces to protect Ukrainian airspace from Russian airstrikes, aircraft, drones, missiles, and artillery fire;
          * the involvement of NATO and allied troops in Ukraine’s defense in all possible forms;
          * conducting military training not only within home territories, such as under NATO frameworks, but also inside Ukraine or in its border areas, forming a buffer zone between Russia and Ukraine to reduce Russia’s military involvement;
          * creating no-fly zones for Russian aviation — either over Ukraine, parts of it, or border areas of Russia, including specifically over Crimea and the Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine.

## Forms of Information in the War Against Russia, Aimed at Victory

* Beyond *Information in the Fight Against Evil* as a general concept, we must also distinguish specific forms:

  * The fight against Russian disinformation in all its forms (which already exists, operates, and is being maintained).
  * Additionally, we must understand other forms — those not yet established, still emerging or being defined:

    * For example, Russia’s nuclear blackmail, in its various forms and at different levels — in propaganda sources and more locally, through schools and teachers, through state institutions within Russia and abroad.
    * Especially important is to understand the *semantics of Russian propaganda*, where it doesn’t openly qualify as propaganda but rather as *discourse* between Russian leaders and Western representatives:

      * The West must learn that *any* discourse with Russia or its representatives should be treated as a propaganda tool used by Russia, aimed at a double audience — its own internal one and the external, Western one.

        * This form of propaganda is especially dangerous and often poorly recognized.
          In the West, people may laugh at what seems to be Russian “stupidity,” while behind those “foolish” remarks lies refined messaging for Russia’s domestic audience.
          Western representatives should carefully study such discourse to distinguish what is meant for internal consumption and what is sent outward to deceive Western societies.

          * How to resist such covert propaganda? — One must *not* respond to Russia’s seemingly casual remarks, behind which lie well-crafted propaganda tricks.
          * It is astonishing how a bloodstained regime like Russia’s can so “innocently” engage in discussions about Western values — and how Western representatives, entering such discourse and arguing, fall into a spider’s web that Russian media eagerly use to feed processed versions of these discussions back to their hypnotized domestic audience.

## On the Nature of Information and Its Organizing Functions

* Let us pause for a brief methodological note to consider some aspects of information relevant to us.
* Information, in the sense that concerns us, consists of two parts:

  1. the *flow of information* (the stream of news), and
  2. the *comprehension of information*.
* In the aspect of comprehension, let us recall a thought by **Nikola Tesla**, borrowed from *Philosophy of Physics* (@PhilosophyOfPhy), where also Tesla’s portrait appears.

### Education should not be the mechanical learning of subjects, but training of the mind to think

* The information we receive as a flow of news — particularly in the context of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine — must also be *evaluated* and *understood*,
  so that it can later be used in our arguments, discourses, and reasoning.
  Here we are guided by this idea of Nikola Tesla quoted above.
  Today, we will also use tools unavailable in Tesla’s time — *artificial intelligence.*
  Therefore, to our thesis **Information in the Fight Against Evil** we add the contribution of artificial intelligence,
  denoted by the phrase **AI against Evil** (*MI cīņā pret Ļaunumu*).

* We can further ask: in which sense is information a weapon in the fight against evil —
  in its first aspect, as a flow of news, or in the second, as information organized in the light of logical understanding?
* It’s important to grasp that both aspects participate in this function — *Information Against Evil*:

  * It matters that we comprehend, analyze, and apply information; thus, *understanding* is an essential part of the thesis *Information Against Evil.*
    Yet once we grasp the content of information, we realize that at the foundation lies the stream of events, history, and what brings it forth — including *providence*.
  * To describe this more fully, let us name three levels:

    * **planetary education**
    * **noosphere**
    * **providence**
  * How does information operate across these three levels?

    * **planetary education** — where we actively participate, both receiving and building it, already involving AI;
    * **noosphere** — existing perhaps in Vernadsky’s sense, or in ways still unknown, possibly co-created with AI, which may become something not yet conceived;
    * **providence** — manifesting through events that reach us as information, toward which we move as we better understand the noosphere.
