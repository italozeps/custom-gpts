Main works of Emanuels Grinbergs in differential geometry: 
On osculation, superosculation and characteristic points
Par oskulāciju, superoskulāciju un charakteristiskiem punktiem

ABOUT ONE GEOMETRIC VARIATION PROBLEM


Pēdējais darbs diferenciālajā ģeometrijā Grinbergam bija ABOUT ONE GEOMETRIC VARIATION PROBLEM 1958. gadā krievu valodā. To mēs vēl neesam pētījuši. Bet skaidrs no darba caurskates, ka te Grinbergs beidzot ir lietojis tenzorus.

Most of works of E. Grinbergs are in graph theory, combinatorics and in electrical circuits and filters. Works in differential geometry are mentioned only marginal. Why Grinbergs after 1960 didn't return to differential geometry is very interesting and might be very strange question. Grinbergs in Soviet time was persecuted by regime, KGB,  and these both things turn to be closely related, no matter how strange it may seem. 

We had several seminars concerning E. Grinbergs about n dimensional Euclide space curves:

My colleague from Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science, Paulis Ķikusts helped me in these researches. We worked with him in area of Graph theory, but now we had to change our field to differential geometry. How we succeeded in this, may be judged looking in our work there. I tried to involve in this work Mark Neizvestny, who lives in Izrael. He helped me with E.G. thesis preparation to electronic form. Mark was more close with E.G. and could tell us many stories about him, both of life, but professional things too.
Mans kolēģis Paulis Ķikusts man ļoti palīdzēja, jo mēs esam ļoti atšķirīgi mūsu matematisko metožu lietošanā, prasmēs un lietu interpretācijā. Paulis ir ļoti praktisks, ļoti labs programmētājs, kad jārisina sarežģitāki uzdevumi. Daudzas lietas šeit E.G. problēmu risināšanā es bez Pauļa palīdzības nebūtu nekad atrisinājis. Es esmu vairāk uz ideju aplūkošanu, koncepciju veidošanu, bet man nav tādas programēšanas prakses kā Paulim. Es pēdējā laikā, pēdējos gados, programmēju tikai Wolfram Mathematica vidē. Bet Paulis to nelieto, bet programmē tajās valodās, kuras lieto profesionālie programmētāji. 
Es strādāju kopā ar E.Grinbergu visīsāko laiku, no 1977. gada novembra līdz kad E.G. aizgāja mūžībā 1982. gadā. Paulis un Marks bija kopā ar E.G. daudz ilgāk. E.G. vadīja disertācijas gan Paulim gan Markam, bet es līdz tam netiku. 

Main works of Emanuel Grinberg in graph theory:
Threeconnected graphs with  only one Hamiltonian circuit ( here in two versions, with  DZ as coauthor and without) 

The paper Threeconnected graphs with  only one Hamiltonian circuit is compiled by Dainis Zeps, from tree pieces that Grinbergs gave to him when they were working together.  Zeps added in the tables, matrices computed by computer. Grinbergs didn't have these data. Comparing his arguments, shows how brilliantly worked the mind of Grinbergs in solving this small problem. 
How we came to idea about 1H  graphs? I had built an algorithm to find Hamiltonian cycle in the graph, so, naturalily, I  came to wish to check  its ability to find  H. cycles in whatever situation.  I came to Grinberg with question how to build graph with only one Hamintonian circuit.  We start to build such graphs, but then Grinberg observed that they aren't 3-connected. Then he raised  question - does there exist such 3-connected graphs? Besides, he remembered that had discussed with some mathematicians question about if there exist triangulation with only one Hamiltonian circuit. Some years later we solved this question with Jan Kratochvil. Jan added one more characteristic: if H. cycle exist then at least 4 such should be there in triangulation. 

I added the first letter that I received from Gordon Royle, on 3rd September, 2018. In the same day I sent a letter with picture Grinb.jpg that I add here where  I show that his graph is built from two Petersen graph modifications adding some edges, ie. the same operation that Grinberg used to build his graphs, described in his paper Threeconnected graphs with  only one Hamiltonian circuit .

On September 27 Gordon Royle gave a talk about Uniquely hamiltonian graphs, https://www.ntu.edu.sg/docs/nielibraries/mme/seminars/2018/uniquely-hamiltonian-graphs.pdf?sfvrsn=e5a8937_3. The talk itslelf is present here: UNIQUELY HAMILTONIAN GRAPHS, Gordon Royle, THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
